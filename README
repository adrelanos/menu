README - menu
-------------

menu is a menu-generator originally made for Debian. It provides an
update-menus program to generate menus for different providers of menus
(both window managers and console applications like pdmenu).

Menu files are placed in /usr/share/menu by packages. update-menus then reads
these files and passes them to install-menu which generates a menu specified
by a menu-method (placed in /etc/menu-method).

The full documentation for menu can be found in doc/menu.txt.gz or
doc/menu.html/
