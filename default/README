In this directory, the menu package has installed some example
menu files. Although changing them in this directory may work,
the local systemadmin (you?) is best adviced to put the local
menu files in /etc/menu, as, otherwise your changes are deleted
when you update the menu package.

For more info, please read /usr/share/doc/menu/html
