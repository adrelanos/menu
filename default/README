In this directory, the menu package has installed some example
menu files. Although changing them in this directory may work,
the local systemadmin (you?) is best adviced to put the local
menu files in /etc/menu, as, otherwise your changes are deleted
when you update the menu package.

For more info, please read /usr/share/doc/menu/html

If you want to convert your old menuentry files to the new format, you
can use the convert-menuentries command. For example given the README
file above, it will convert it into: (I accedentally did this):

?package(README):needs="In" section="this" icon="the" title="menu" command="package has installed some example"
?package(README):needs="menufiles." section="Although" icon="them" title="in" command="this directory may work,"
?package(README):needs="the" section="local" icon="(you?)" title="is" command="best adviced to put the local"
?package(README):needs="menufiles" section="in" icon="as," title="otherwise" command="your changes are deleted"
?package(README):needs="when" section="you" icon="the" title="menu" command="package."
?package(README):needs="For" section="more" icon="please" title="read" command="/usr/share/doc/menu/html"
