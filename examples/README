In this directory, I'll put some examples for the /etc/menu-methods scripts.

These are just that: examples. The files here are included to show
you how to write menu-methods, or to copy them to the
window-manager you're maintaining (please check them if you do!)
if you're not interested in all that, but just want to have menu's
you're probably better of using any of the window-managers that
work together with menu already (olvwm, fvwm2, afterstep, wm2, pdmenu...)

The menu-methods in this directory use the new "!include" + "function"
features of menu-1.4. This means, that by changing the definitions
in /etc/menu-methods/menu.h, you can change the look of all menus in
all window managers (that use these new features).


For more info on the menu-methods themselves, read /usr/share/doc/menu/html.

Some of the menu-methods in this directory use the "rcfile" stuff
(grep "examplercfile" $f; to see). If they do, then you'll also need to
copy the corresponding system.$wm-menu file to the right directory
(see "examplercfile" def, along with rootdir).

***************************
The 9wm window manager:
   If you want to get the debian menus, you should type
   
     /etc/X11/9wm/system.9wmrc --start /Debian
   
   and the menu's will appear in the 9wm menu (mouse 3).
   
   Also, if you, for example, select Apps/Games/Puzzles/xtriangles,
   then, apart from MainMenu, you'll also have an entry for
   Apps, Games and Puzzles in your 9wm menu. I don't know 
   how to fix this (or if it should be "fixed").
