#  /etc/menu-methods/menu-translate file for update-menus.
#
#  NOTE: if you want to translate the menu entries in a different language,
#        DO NOT USE THIS FILE!!!
#        use the GNU internationalisation tools, see the menu source
#        code (menu/po-sections/menu-sections.pot), and send the .po file 
#        you created to us, we'll include it in a next release of menu. 
#
#
#Synopsis:
#
# translate x -> y    #where x and y are one of section, id, title, icon, ...
#   x-name  y-name
#   ...
# endtranslate
#
#The translations are done by update-menus: the menu-methods will not
#have to be aware of this.
#

#There's:
#  translate:     only translate for exact matches (RE "^$match\$"
#  subtranslate:  translate for matches of RE "^$match"
#  substitute:    substitute substrings: sed -s "/^$match/$repl/".
#                 this only works for "substitute x->x", and
#		  will give interesting results for " substitute x->y".
# 
# Language translators: DO NOT USE THIS FILE! (see note on top of this file)

# Examples:
# subtranslate section->section
#   Apps/        Programs/     #Rename Apps to Programs
# endtranslate

# subtranslate section->section
#   Apps/Editors/ Editors/     #Move Editors at the root.
# endtranslate
