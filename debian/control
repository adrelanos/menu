Description: generates programs menu for all menu-aware applications
 Debian menu keeps transparently the menus in the different
 window-managers in sync with the list of installed programs. 
 .
 Debian menu relies on a list of menu entries provided by programs
 and a list of menu-methods provided by window-managers and other
 menu-aware applications.
 .
 Menu provides system-level and user-level configuration and overrides
 for both menu entries and menu-methods.
