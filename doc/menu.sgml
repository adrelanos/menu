The <tt/menu/ package was inspired by the <tt/install-fvwm2-menu/
program from the old <prgn/fvwm2/ package. However, <tt/menu/ tries to
provide a more general interface for menu building.  With the
<prgn/update-menus/ command from this package, no package needs to be
modified for every X window manager again, and it provides a unified
interface for both text- and X-oriented programs.

<chapt>Introduction
<p>

Before  the  advent  of  <tt/update-menus/,  when  the sysadmin
installed a package onto a Debian system, they would  need
to  edit  various  window manager config files to make the
new program show up on, for  example,  <tt/fvwm/'s  menus.  The
menus  could  easily become out of sync with what programs
were actually available, with some menu items that  didn't
work,  and  other  programs  that  lacked  a  menu  entry.
update-menus and Debian's menu package aim to  solve  this
problem.
<p>

<tt/update-menus/  automatically  generates  menus of installed
programs for window managers and other menu  programs.  It
should  be  run whenever a menu file or menu-method file
is changed.  <tt/update-menus/ will be ran  automatically  when
Debian  packages  that contain menu files are installed or
removed from the system. Users themselves can add/delete menu items,
and should then run <tt/update-menus/ as that user, thus creating
window-manager startup files that are used in preference to the
systemwide files.
<p>

One problem we ran into with menu-1.x (and before) was that the
number of entries in any submenu vary wildly: on my system there are
only two entries in /Apps/Editors, while I'm sure that other people
have more like 20 entries there. Many people complained about the
fullness of certain submenus, citing scientific studies or personal
experience to explain why overfull or underfull submenus are a bad
thing. To overcome this, menu-2.0 now can optimize the tree itself,
possibly subdividing for example the /Apps/Editors tree in, say
Editors/Beginner, Editors/Experienced, or whatever, if there are many
entries in that submenu, or maybe even totally removing /Apps/Editors
on systems where there are few editors installed. To be able to do
this, menu follows the information supplied to it in the `hints'
variables (see paragraph below, or the hints chapter).


<p>

Each package that needs to add an entry to the menu tree, 
includes a menu file <tt>/usr/lib/menu/package-name</tt>. In
this file, it will have one line per menu entry, like this (copied
from <tt>/usr/lib/menu/xbase</tt>):
<example>
   ?package(xbase):command="/usr/bin/X11/xedit" needs="X11" \
                section="Apps/Editors" title="Xedit" \
                hints="Beginner,Small"
</example>
This describes the type of interface Xedit needs (X11),
the menu section the menu entry should be in,
the menu text, and the command that should be executed.
Also, it tells menu that, if /Apps/Editors is overfull, 
it could put Xedit in a Apps/Editors/Beginner or Apps/Editors/Small 
subsection.

<p>

Whenever <tt/root/ runs <prgn/update-menus/, it will check all
menu files in <tt>/etc/menu</tt> and <tt>/usr/lib/menu</tt>,
and run the installation scripts that display managers like <prgn/fvwm2/
should provide in <tt>/etc/menu-methods</tt>.
<p>

The menu package itself provides a set of default menu files,
for people to get the idea, and to speed up things a bit.
(These files should be incorporated into the package.)
<p>

Note, that substantial and incompatible changes took place with the
menu-1.0 release, while substantial features were added by the release
of menu-2.0. This document describes menu-2.0. 
Menu-2.0 now doesn't accept the menu-methods written for menu-0.x, but
for most window managers that still have those old menu-methods, I
have put new style menu-methods in /usr/share/doc/menu/examples. Everything
written for menu-1.0 will work with menu-2.0.
<p>

Most notable changes between menu-0.x and menu-1.x are listed in the file
README.changes in the menu package, the features added by menu-2.0 can
be summarised here: hints, and the menu-2 compat mode. (where lines
are finished by a ';' instead of a newline).

<chapt> Menu from the viewpoint of a user
<p>
<sect> How/when do the window manger startup files get created?
<p>
Basically, you as user don't need to know any of how and when the
startupfiles are created, but you might be interested to know anyway.
<p>
When a package that wants to add something to the menu tree gets
installed, it will run <tt/update-menus/ in its <tt/postinst/ script.
Update-menus then reads in all menu files in <tt>/etc/menu/</tt>
<tt>/usr/lib/menu</tt> and <tt>/usr/share/menu/default</tt>, and stores
the menu entries of all installed packages in memory. Once that has
been done, it will run the menu-methods in
<tt>/etc/menu-methods/*</tt>, and pipe the information about the menu
entries to the menu-methods on stdout, so that the menu-methods can
read this. Each Window Manager or other program that wants to have
the Debian menu tree, will supply a menu-method script in
<tt>/etc/menu-methods/</tt>. This menu-method then knows how to
generate the startup-file for that window manager. To facilitate this
task for the window-manager maintainers, menu provides a
<tt>install-menu</tt> program. This program can generate the
startupfiles for just about every window manager.

<sect> Tuning of the generated window manager startup files
<p>

In principle this is a very window-manager specific business.
But for all window managers (and others) applies:
<p>
The file to attack is the menu-method in 
<tt>/etc/menu-methods/$wm</tt>, with <tt/$wm/ the
name of your window manager. However, if this menu-method
<tt/!include/-s the <tt/menu.h/ file (as it should), you can also edit
that file, to make your changes work for every installed window
manager.
<p>
If the menu-method file of your window manager does <tt/!include/ the
<tt/menu.h/ file, and makes proper use of the definitions in there,
then you can look at the comments in that <tt/menu.h/ file to see how
you can make minor adjustments to the look of your menus in your
window manager.
<p>
To generally change the menu tree, see the next section.

<sect> Optimization of menu tree: hints
<p>
If <tt/hint_optimize=true/ has been set in a menu-method script (actually, that definition should appear in
the <tt/!include/-ed <tt/menu.h/ file), then install-menu will try to
alter the menu tree, to make every submenu have about the optimum
number of menu entries (as specified by <tt/hints_nentry=.../). It
will do that by removing under-full submenus (only if the `parent' of
that submenu isn't itself already overfull), and by possibly creating
new submenus, using hints. Note, however, that the optimization of the
tree takes in principle exponential time, so menu speeds up the
process, at the expense of occasionally not finding the best tree. So,
the tree you are presented with may not be optimal. For tuning
variables, see the hint_* variables in the last chapter.

<chapt> The menu file 
<p>
<sect> Location
<p>
Packages provided menu files should be in <file>/usr/lib/menu/</file>.
System-local menu files should be in <file>/etc/menu/</file>.
User-specific menu files should be in <file>~/.menu/</file>
<sect> Syntax
<p> The format is
<example>
?package(package[,package2,...]): \
   field1="value1"\
   field2="value2"\
</example>
<p>
Here is an example to describe the syntax of such a file:
<example>
?package(gnumeric):\           specifies what packages need to be installed
                               multiple requirements should be separated by
                               comma
  needs="X11"\                 what kind of environment this command expects
  section="Apps/Math"\         in what section this menu entry should be
  title="Gnumeric"\            the title of the menu entry
  command="gnumeric" \         the command to run
  hints="Gnome,Spreadsheets" \ some hints about menu placement.
  icon="/usr/share/pixmaps/gnumeric.xpm"  the path to the icon to use.
</example>
<p>
A number sign ("#") can be used to include comments. An entry must be
terminated by a newline, however you can use \ to escape a newline.
<p>
Values must be quoted with ", and meta-character (", \, newline) must be
escaped with a \.
<p>
You can include several entries in the same files. 
<p>
The file must be encoded in ASCII 7bit. This is necessary to accomodate 
window managers that do not support 8bit. However the translations are not
limited in encoding.

<p> <tt/?package(...)/ contains a comma-separated list of packages that
need to be installed for the menu entry to be displayed. That should include
the package containing the menu file and any packages necessary to run the
command not depended by the package nor essential.  Users can use
pseudo packages names starting by <tt/local./ which are assumed to be always
installed.
<p> The fields <tt/needs/, <tt/section/, <tt/title/ and <tt/command/ are
mandatory. Other fields are optional. Custom fields are supported, so
you can add new fields for you own purpose. If a field is specified multiple
times in a menuentry, the last instance will be used.

<sect> The <tt/title/ field
<p>

The <tt/title/ must follow the following requirements:
<enumlist>
  <item> It must be short. There is an optional <tt/longtitle/ field for
  users that want longer titles.
  <item> It must be properly capitalized. Use <em/Emacs/ and not <em/emacs/.
  <item> It must be unique. Two entries must not have the same title.
</enumlist>

<sect> The <tt/needs/ field
<p>

The following <tt/needs/ are documented for use in the Debian menu.
<enumlist>
  <item> <tt/X11/: if this program runs under X11.
  <item> <tt/text/: if it runs under a terminal.  X11 window managers will
  spawn a X terminal emulator.
  <item> <tt/vc/: if it runs under the linux console but not under a virtual
  terminal.
  <item> <tt/wm/: if it is a X11 window manager. The current window manager
  will exec(2) this program to avoid "Another window manager is running"
  errors.
</enumlist>
<p>

A menu manager can use a special <tt/needs/ named after the package for
menu entries that must only be displayed in this menu manager.
Examples include <tt/fvwm/ modules, <tt/dwww/ menu entries.
<p>

A program like gnumeric which can be run on X11 as well as on a text
terminal should <em/not/ have an extra entry with <tt/needs=X11/
because it will then be next to impossible to configure the window
managers to spawn <prgn/rxvt/ instead of the default <prgn/xterm/.
<p>

On the other hand, if a program (like <prgn/emacs/) can be run as real X
application as well as in a terminal, two entries should be listed,
otherwise the program will always be run in an <prgn/xterm/ (or
<prgn/rxvt/). Though you must remember, that two entries are never allowed
to have the same title. The title must be unique.
<p>
<sect> The <tt/section/ field
<p>
The section field hold a / separated list of hierarchical sections components.
<p>
The <em/authoritative list of Debian's menu structure/ is maintained
in the Debian Menu sub-policy document which is part of the Debian
Policy package.
<p>
The menu structure below is included only for convenience and is not authoritative. If it disagree with the structure in the Debian Menu sub-policy, please
send a wishlist bug to the <tt/menu/ package.
<p>
Please do <em/not/ put your packages into any other sections.
<p>

<example>
       Apps            - normal apps
         Databases     - interactive database programs
         Editors       - text editors, word processors
         Education     - educational and training programs
         Emulators     - dosemu, etc.
         Graphics      - image manipulation
         Hamradio      - anything relating to ham radio.
         Math          - maxima, octave, oleo, etc.
         Net           - mail, news, web, irc, etc.
         Programming   - debuggers, etc.
         Science       - scientific programs
         Tools         - other tools: xclock, xmag, xman, etc.
         Technical     - technical stuff.
         Text          - text oriented tools other than editors.
         Shells        - bash, ksh, zsh, etc.
         Sound         - sound players and editors
         Viewers       - image viewers
         System        - system administration and monitoring tools
       Games           - games and recreations
         Adventure     - walk around virtual space, zork, MOO's, etc
         Arcade        - any game where reflexes count
         Board         - like gnuchess, pente, gnugo
         Card          - solitaire, etc
         Puzzles       - Stuff from xpuzzles, ...
         Simulation
         Sports        - Games derived from "real world" sports
         Strategy      - games involving long term strategic thinking
         Tetris-like   - games involving falling blocks
         Toys          - oneko, xeyes, etc.
       Help            - programs that provide user documentation
       Screen          - programs that affect the whole screen 
         Lock          - xlock, etc.
         Save          - screen savers
         Root-window   - things that fill the root window
       WindowManagers  - X window managers 
         Modules       - window manager modules
       XShells         - shells (like xterm, rxvt, ...)
</example>
For users wanting to access some menu entries quickly, you can also put
entries in the root menu. This is done by using <em>section="/"</em>.
Package provided menu entries must never use this feature.

<sect> The <tt/command/ field
<p>
The command field holds the command that should be executed when the
menu entry is selected. Commands will be executed with <prgn/sh -c/
using 
<example>
execl("/bin/sh","sh","-c",command)
</example>
or the equivalent.

<sect> The <tt/icon/ field
<p>

Please, make sure the icons you specify are always available on the
system. So, if you want to have an icon with your menu entry, the
preferred method is to supply the icon with that package. Also, to
prevent the distribution of icons files to turn too much into a mess,
please put all icon files in the directory
<tt>/usr/share/pixmaps</tt>.
<p>

Debian package maintainers should ensure that any icons they include
for use in the Debian menus conform to the following points:
<enumlist>
  <item>The icons should be in xpm format.
  <item>The icons may not be larger than 32x32 pixels, although smaller
  sizes are ok.
  <item>The background area of the icon should be transparent, if
  possible.
</enumlist>
<p>

You can provide both 16x16 and 32x32 pixels icons using the variables icon16x16
and icon32x32 so that the user can configure menu to use one or the other.
<p>

If you, as a system administrator, don't like the icons in the menus, simply
change the <tt/icon()/ function from the file
<tt>/etc/menu-methods/menu.h</tt>, and run <prgn/update-menus/.
<p>

<sect> The <tt/hints/ field
<p>
Hints are used to help menu structure generated menus in a more optimal way.
For example:
<p>
<example>
?package(emacs20):\
  needs="x11"\
  hints="Big,Expert,Featureful" \
  section="Apps/Editors"\
  title="Emacs 20"\
  command="/usr/bin/emacs20"\
  icon=/usr/share/emacs/20.3/etc/emacs.xbm
</example>
The above hints will case <tt/menu/ to consider grouping <tt/emacs/
together with other editors that are marked similar. For example, if
<tt/vi/ on your system has a hints="Small,Expert" definition, and
there are too many entries in the /Apps/Editors menuentry, then menu
will consider creating a /Apps/Editors/Expert submenu, and put both
<tt/vi/ and <tt/emacs/ in it. (of course, only if you have 
<tt/hint_optimize=true/ in your /etc/menu-methods/menu.h file).

<sect>Fvwm's task and title bars
<p>

The problem with the stuff in the task bar is that all items are
displayed all of the time. So, if 1500 Debian packages all were to
register a button, the buttons would quickly fill the screen, making
the exercise useless. The few applications that are considered
important enough to be listed in the task bar usually vary widely on
each system, making it impossible to select a ``happy few'' apps that
are allowed there on every Debian system. If you (as a local system
administrator) want your <prgn/fvwm2/ to have a few buttons, you can
install files for those packages in <tt>/menu/$package</>, containing
a menu entry like this:
<example>
  ?Package(xmball):needs=button\
                section=Games/Puzzles\
                icon=path-to-pixmap.xpm\
                title="Xmball"\
                command=/usr/games/xmball
</example>
Then, do the following:
<example>
  cd /etc/menu-methods/
  cp fvwm2 fvwm2button
  vi fvwm2button
</example>
and remove all the "supported" entries, adding the one below. For the rest,
leave everything the same except those listed below.
<example>
  supported 
    button="+ Style \"" $title "\" TitleIcon" $icon " Exec "  $command "\n"
  endsupported
  startmenu:   "AddToTitlebar \n"
  endmenu:     "\n"
  submenutitle:""
  mainmenu:
  genmenu:   "buttondefs.hook"
</example>
(Of course regular users (not system administrators) can also specify
`buttonfiles' in their ~/.menu/ directory).

<chapt>What packages with applications should do
<sect> Providing a menu file
<p>
A package should provide a menu file
<tt>/usr/lib/menu/&lt;package-name&gt;</tt> that contains
information about each program it likes to make available in the
menus.
<p>
<sect> Adding a hook for dpkg in your packages
<p>
You should add a line like this to your <tt/postinst/ script
<example>
 if test -x /usr/bin/update-menus; then update-menus; fi
</example>
and the <tt/postrm/ script should get the line
<example>
 if test -x /usr/bin/update-menus; then update-menus; fi
</example>
(that is, the same line in postinst and in postrm).
<p>

<chapt>What packages with menu managers should do
<p>

Each package containing a <em/menu manager/ (i.e. a program that can
display a menu) should provide a script or program in
<tt>/etc/menu-methods/</> that can read the menu files. This script
will be executed by <prgn/update-menus/, which will feed the menu
entries to be installed to your script via standard input (stdin).
<p>

The scripts in <tt>/etc/menu-methods/</> should be configuration
files, so the user can tune the behaviour of the script, and they must always
include the <tt>/etc/menu-methods/menu.h</> configuration file at the beginning
with the command <tt>!include menu.h</>

For the same reason, scripts in <tt>/etc/menu-methods/</> are requested
to use the following configurable functions:

<tt/title()/ for the title (in place of <tt/$title/),
<tt/icon()/ for the icon (in place of <tt/$icon/),
<tt/term()/ for running <tt/text/ command under <tt/X11/.
<tt/sections_translations()/ for the list of translations of sections name
available. This later one is only defined if you <tt>!include lang.h</tt>
<p>

Good examples for these scripts for nearly all Debian window managers
are included in the <tt/menu/ package in
<tt>/usr/share/doc/menu/examples</tt>. Note that while working on your script,
you can use the tricks described in "The internals of the menu
package", section "The update-menus program", to run just your script,
instead of having update-menus run all scripts (can save quite a lot
of time).
<p>

This script should not be executable in the package. Instead
the <tt/postinst/ should add the execute bit and then run
<prgn/update-menus/ (if it is executable).
<p>

Similarly, the <tt/postrm/ script when called with option ``remove'' should
remove the execute bit and run <prgn/update-menus/ (if it is executable).
<p>

Here is an example of such a <tt/postrm/ script using <prgn/sh/:
<example>
  #!/bin/sh
  set -e
  inst=/etc/menu-methods/#PACKAGE#
  case "$1" in
     remove)
        if [ -f $inst ]; then
                chmod a-x $inst
                if [ -x /usr/bin/update-menus ]; then update-menus ; fi
        fi
     ;;
     purge)
         #remove the files that install-menu creates:
         (cd /etc/X11/twm/; rm system.twmrc menus.dat menudefs.hook)
     ;;
     upgrade);;
     *)
         echo "postrm called with unknown argument \`$1'" >&2
         exit 0
     ;;
  esac
</example>

And here is a good example for a <tt/postinst/ script:
<example>
  #!/bin/sh
  set -e
  inst=/etc/menu-methods/#PACKAGE#
  if [ -f $inst ]; then
      chmod a+x $inst
      if [ -x /usr/bin/update-menus ]; then
          update-menus
      fi
  fi
</example>
<p>
<var>Note:</var>
<p>
<var>
 Previous version of menu were advertising the script
 <tt>/usr/sbin/wm-menu-config</tt>. There was a flaw: this script
 was only available when menu is installed and so the menu-method
 script was not executable if menu was installed afterward.
 </var><p><var>
 This script is considered deprecated, please don't use it anymore.
 </var>
<p>
Please, do not make your package <em/depend/ on the menu package! The
preferred way of telling dpkg that your wm can cooperate with menu is:
<example>
   Suggests: menu
</example>
Please only consider using "depends" if you feel providing reasonable
defaults for systems without menu will make life very difficult for you.
<p>

<chapt>How a user can override the menus
<p>

<sect>Configuring the menus
<p>

A user can specify his/her own menu entries in the <tt>~/.menu</> directory.
The files can have an arbitrary file name as long as the new syntax
for the menu entries is used. They should start with either
<example>
  ?package(installed-package):
</example>
or
<example>
  ?package(local.mystuff):
</example>
if it's something that isn't ``debian-officially'' installed. (Any
``package'' that starts with ``<tt/local./'' is considered installed.)
<p>

If a user wants to have his/her own menu methods, he/she should create
a <tt>~/.menu-methods</> directory and put all scripts he/she wants to
be run in it. (If <tt>~/.menu-methods</> exists,
<tt>/etc/menu-methods</> will not be searched when a user runs
<prgn/update-menus/).
<p>

A system administrator should place system-wide menu entries in
<tt>/etc/menu</> (not in <tt>/usr/lib/menu/package</>, since these
files will probably be overwritten by a package upgrade).
<p>

<sect>Specifying that a menu entry should not be displayed
<p>

If a user wants to remove an entry from the system menu (in
<tt>/etc/menu</>), then this will do the trick:
<example>
  echo -n  > ~/.menu/package
</example>
The zero-size file will tell <prgn/update-menus/ that the
corresponding package should not have any menu entries listed.
<p>

<sect> Including others files
<p>

<var> Historical comment by Joost:</var> 
<p>
<var>
More out of curiosity than anything else, I recently read the KDE
mailing list. In it I saw some discussion about how good the Debian
menu system is (whow, thanks, guys!), but one person found a missing
feature: s/he said you couldn't include other files in the user
menu files. Well, actually, it was already possible, but not very well
documented. 
</var>
<p>
To include the contents of file /usr/lib/menu/somefile,
add this to your menu file:

<example>
!include /usr/lib/menu/somefile
</example>

Apart form that, it is of course possible to make the menu entry file
executable (<tt>chmod a+x ~/.menu/package</>), and do something like
<example>
#!/bin/sh
cat  /usr/lib/menu/somefile
sed -e  "/unwanted_entry/s/?package(/?package(notinstalled./" \
     /usr/lib/menu/someotherfile
</example>
to get the same effect, with the added flexibility of being able to
filter out unwanted lines.

<chapt>The internals of the menu package
<p>

<sect>The update-menus program
<p>

On startup, update-menus checks the file
<tt>/var/run/update-menus.pid</> and the pid in it. If there's an
<prgn/update-menus/ process with that pid it kills it.
If <tt>/var/lib/dpkg/lock</> exists, it forks to background and
returns control to dpkg. The background process checks the
<tt>/var/lib/dpkg/lock</> file approx. every second until the file's
gone. 
<p>

After that, <prgn/update-menus/ reads the menu-entry-files in
the following directories:<tt> /etc/menu /usr/lib/menu /usr/share/menu/default
</>
(if a user runs <prgn/update-menus/, it will add ~/.menu to the
front of that list). For every menu entry line in each file it checks
if the corresponding package is installed (works on file bases for old
syntax menu entry files). The menu entries of all "installed" packages
are added together in one big buffer that is kept in memory (exception:
executable menu entry files are executed, and stdout is placed in
the buffer). 
<p>
Once it's read all menu entry files, <prgn/update-menus/ starts all
executable scripts in /etc/menu-methods/, hands the scripts the
previously created buffer via stdin. (If <prgn/update-menus/ is ran by
a user, it will first try to run the scripts in ~/.menu-methods, and
only if that directory doesn't exist, it will run the scripts in
/etc/menu-methods). 
<p>

Note that as an aid to debugging, one can use
<example>
update-menus --stdout > /tmp/menu-stdin
</example>
and then view the file /tmp/menu-stdin to see exactly what
<tt/update-menus/ handed the menu-methods on their stdin.
<p>

This may also be useful for people
writing /etc/menu-method/* scripts: Running <prgn/update-menus/ every
time you changed something in the script may be quite
time-consuming. So, it's much easier to run 
<prgn/update-menus --stdout/ once, and then run
<example>
  /etc/menu-methods/mymethod < /tmp/menu-stdin
</example>
(and, if that also takes too long, just try editing /tmp/menu-stdin,
and removing 90% or so of all entries)

<sect>The install-menu program
<p>

The files <tt>/etc/menu-methods/$wm</> are executable config
files that start with the line
<example>
  #!/usr/sbin/install-menu
</example>
and thus start that program, handing it the configuration file for the
specific window manager in the first command line argument. This
configuration consists of:
<enumlist>
<item>the compatibility mode ("menu-1" or "menu-2").
<item>where the various files should be stored/read.
<item>what "needs" are supported, and what wrapper files should
   be used for each "type".
</enumlist>
See <tt>/usr/share/doc/menu/examples/</> of the menu package for more
comments.
<p>

Options to <prgn/install-menu/:
<example>
  -v              be verbose
  -d              Produce loads of debugging output
</example>
<p>

Some window managers don't support an `include' like statement in
their <tt/system.*rc/ files (like <prgn/m4/ or <prgn/cpp/
preprocessing), they cannot read the <tt/menudefs.hook/ file generated
by install-menu from their
<tt/system.*rc/ config file. To still be able to use them,
<prgn/install-menu/ will copy the file
<tt>$path/$examplercfile</tt> to <tt>$path/$rcfile</tt> (with 
<tt/$examplercfile/ and <tt/$rcfile/ defined in the
<prgn/install-menu/ config file, and <tt/$path/ either the
<tt/$rootprefix/ or <tt>${HOME}/$userprefix</tt>, depending on whether root
or user executed the file.), and replace all occurrences of
``install-menu-defs'' with the <tt/$genmenu/ file it just
generated. 
<p>
As an example, consider the following:
<tt>examplercfile=system.foo-wm-example</tt>,
<tt>rcfile=system.foo-wm</tt>, <tt>genmenu=menudefs.hook</tt> and
<tt>rootprefix=/etc/X11/foo-wm</tt>. Now, if <prgn/install-menu/ gets run, it
will first generate the file
<tt>/etc/X11/foo-wm/menudefs.hook</tt>. Next, it will line-by-line 
read the file <tt>/etc/X11/foo-wm/system.foo-wm-example</tt> and copy
it's contents to <tt>/etc/X11/foo-wm/system.foo-wm</tt>, replacing
every occurrence of the string <tt>install-menu-defs</tt> by the
contents
of the file <tt>/etc/X11/foo-wm/menudefs.hook</tt>. 
<p>

To activate the file copying in this way, simply define the
<tt/$examplercfile/ and <tt/$rcfile/ variables in the
<prgn/install-menu/ configuration file
(for example, see <tt>/etc/menu-methods/fvwm</tt>), and make sure there is a
<tt>$path/$examplercfile</> (<tt>$path</> being either
<tt/$rootprefix/, or <tt/$userprefix/.)
<p>

If you are wringing a menu method, you can use the following to
debug it somewhat easier:
<enumlist>
<item>use <tt>update-menus --stdout > /tmp/menu-stdin </tt>
to create a list of menu entries in <tt>/tmp/menu-stdin</tt>
and then
<item>you can run just your menu-method with (if it's called wm):
<example>
  ./wm -v < /tmp/menu-stdin 
</example>
(Use <tt/-v/ for verbose, <tt/-d/ for debugging, and you'll get loads
of output!)
</enumlist>
<p>

<sect>The install-menu config script definitions
<p>

The menu-methods in <tt>/etc/menu-methods/*</> are basically made up of
a lot of ``tag=string'' definitions, explaining <prgn/install-menu/
how to generate a <tt/system.$wmrc/ script. This way you can tune
the look of generated <tt/system.$wmrc/ to your needs.
<p>

In the following, something like 
<example>
  treewalk="c(m)"
</example>
means that the treewalk variable by default has the value "c(m)".
<p>

For examples of what these scripts can look like, see
<tt>/usr/share/doc/menu/examples/*</>.
<p>

<taglist>
<tag><tt/compat="menu-1"/
<item>
Two mode are defined:
<taglist>
<tag> <tt/"menu-1"/ <item> menu directives are terminated by an end-of-line character. </item>
<tag> <tt/"menu-2"/ <item>menu directives are terminated by semi-comma character. </item>
</taglist>
This must be just after the <tt>!include "menu.h"</tt> directive so that
<file>menu.h</file> can use its own compat mode.

<tag><tt/outputencoding="UTF-8"/
<item> Set the encoding used for output files. Use <tt/iconv --list/ to get
the list of supported encoding. Useful values include "UTF-8" and
"ISO-8859-1".  The special value "LOCALE" means that the current locale
encoding will be used. If set to an empty string, no translations are
performed.  This is the default.

<tag><tt/outputlanguage=""/
<item>
If set to "C" automatic translations will be disabled. Note that you 
can still use translate() to perform explicit translation.

<tag><tt/supported/
<tag><tt/endsupported/
<item>
Between the <tt/supported/ and <tt/endsupported/ keywords you define
what "needs" are supported by this window manager. So, the following
is an example for a wm that supports both needs=x11 and needs=text:
<example>
  function q($s) = "\"" esc($s,"\\\"") "\""
  supported
    x11 =" ShowEntry(" q(title()) ", " q($command) ")"
    text=" ShowEntry(" q(title()) ", " q(term())   ")"
  endsupported
</example>

For the variable substitution (and functions, not shown above), see
the next paragraph. In the above example, you'll notice that for the
menu entries that "need=text", the term() function is used. This is an
user-supplied function that will run $command in a X terminal emulator.  Also,
as x11 is higher up in the supported list above than text, a package that
supplies both a "needs=x11" and a "needs=text" entry will have the needs=x11
entry installed, in favour of the needs=text entry.  You can continue lines on
the next line with a \, but do make sure you don't add any spaces after the \.

<tag><tt/startmenu=""/
<tag><tt/endmenu=""/
<tag><tt/submenutitle=""/
<item>
These define what to print for the beginning/end of a menu, and
how to the print a menu entry that pops up another menu entry.
They are substituted the same way as the "supported" stuff is.
(see next paragraph).

<tag><tt/treewalk="c(m)"/
<item>
This string defines in what order to dump the <tt/$startmenu/, <tt/$endmenu/,
and <tt/$submenutitle/ (and its children). Each char in the string
refers to:
<example>
    c  : dump children of menu.
    m  : dump this menu's $submenutitles
    (  : dump $startmenu
    )  : dump $endmenu
    M  : dump all $submenutitles of this menu and this menu's children.
</example>

The default is "c(m)". For olvwm, one needs: "(M)"

<tag><tt/genmenu=""/
<item>
The menu file to generate (usually something like <tt>system."$wm"rc</>).
The file itself may depend on the level or title that is currently
being worked on, like 
<example>
    genmenu="/subdir/" replacewith($section," ","_") "/rc.menu"
</example>
(Substitution works just like in the supported stuff, see above).
Note that the files made this way are truncated upon
opening, so if you have a genmenu like the example above, then
your <tt/endmenu=/ will override the startmenu stuff (but you probably
only need one of the two anyway).

<tag><tt>rootsection="/Debian"</>
<item>
the prefix, every <tt/$section/ variable gets.

<tag><tt/prerun=""/
<tag><tt/postrun=""/
<item>
The commands to run before resp. after the actual generation of the
<tt/menudefs.hook/ (genmenu) file. Commands will be executed by <prgn/sh/.
Example: 
<example>
  prerun="rm -rf " prefix() "/*"
  postrun="killall -USR1 fvwm2"
</example>
(Substitution works just like the supported stuff, see below).
<tag><tt/preruntest=""/
<item>
Just like prerun, but if the return value of the command is non-zero,
menu will quit.
<tag><tt/also_run=""/
<item>
If non-zero, install-menus will, after generating the output files,
also load the file also_run, and use the new assignments to treewalk,
genmenu, etc to generate more output. This second time, variables like
<tt/prerun/ and all of the hint stuff are ignored.
<p>
Note: NOT just like <tt/prerun/ etc: <tt/prerun/ etc start a command
with /bin/sh, <tt/also_run/ doesn't exec any other command, just tells
install-menu to also load anoter binary, and generate the output.

<tag><tt/onlyrunasroot=false/
<tag><tt/onlyrunasuser=false/
<item>
If onlyrunasroot is set to true, menu will quit silently when run as
user. Similarly for onlyrunasuser.
<var>This is deprecated since it is simpler to just not define
<tt/userprefix/ (resp. <tt/rootprefix/).</var>

<tag><tt>preoutput="#Automatically generated file. Do not edit (see /usr/share/doc/menu/html)\n\n"</tt>
<tag><tt>postoutput=""</tt>
<item>
Text to put at the beginning resp. end of the generated file ($genmenu).

<tag><tt/command=""/
<item>
A command to run instead of <prgn/install-menus/. This command used
to be needed to get around limitations due to compatibility stuff. But
that compatibility with pre menu-1 stuff has been dropped, and isn't
needed any more.
<p>

Example:
<example>
  command="cat > /tmp/menu-stdin"
</example>

<tag><tt/hotkeyexclude=""/
<item>
Keys not to use for hotkey generation. You can use the same 
variables and functions here as in for example the startmenu
sections.
<p>

Example:
<example>
  hotkeyexclude="q" $section
</example>

<tag><tt/hotkeycase="insensitive"/
<item>
can be either "insensitive" or "sensitive". Determines
whether the hotkeys can be of mixed case (<tt/fvwm2/ reads
the hotkeys case-insensitive, <tt/pdmenu/ case-sensitive).
In case of the titles "Xa" and "xb", hotkey case-insensitive will
generate "X" and "b", whereas case-sensitive would generate "X" and
"x".
<p>

<tag><tt/sort=$sort ":" $title/
<item>
Entries within one menu will be alphabetically sorted by whatever
sort returns. So, if you do 
<tt/sort=ifelse($command, "1", "0"):$title/, then all submenus will
appear above the commands in a submenu. (A submenu always has 
<tt/$command=""/). Or, as Joey Hess writes:
<example>
  You can add another field to the menu items, with whatever name you like,
  let's say it's called priority. Then add this line to
  /etc/menu-methods/*:
  
  sort=ifelse($priority, $priority, "9")
  
  This has the result of sorting things so items with a low priority sort to the
  top, and items with no priority default to priority 9 and sort to the bottom.
  
  (Note that it compares the strings alphabetically, not numerically.)
</example>

<tag><tt/rcfile=""/
<item>
If the window manager doesn't support an "include filename" or
"read(filename)" statement in it's config file, you can rename
the wm's config file to <tt>system."$wm"rc-menu</>, and insert
a "install-menu-defs" line (without the quotes, or whitespace around
it, and "install-menu-defs" must be the only thing on the line)
in the <tt>system."$wm"rc-menu</> file. This will then get replaced
by the <tt/$genmenu/ file that was just created (see
also <tt/$examplercfile/).
<p>
  
<tag><tt/examplercfile=""/
<item>
if needed (see <tt/rcfile/), this is the <tt/system.rc"$wm"-menu/
file. In that case, make <tt/rcfile=system.rc"$wm"/.
<p>

<tag><tt/rootprefix=""/
<item>
The prefix to use when running as root (applies to $genmenu, $rcfile,
$examplercfile  and other old cache files). If it is not defined,
the menu-method will be skipped when run as root.

<p>
<tag><tt/userprefix=""/
<item>
As <tt/rootprefix/, but when running as user. userprefix is relative to
the user home directory, unless it start with 2 slashes, in which case it
is treated as an absolute path. If it is not defined, the menu-method will be
skipped when run as a user.
<p>

<tag><tt/hint_optimize=false/
<item>
If set to true, menu will try to generate an `optimal' tree, using
the variables below. If set to false, menu will keep the sections as
they are specified in the menu entry files (and ignore any hint stuff).

<tag><tt/hint_nentry=6/
<item>
Optimal number of entries in a submenu. It's a float, so you can set
it to 5.5 if you cannot decide between 5 and 6. Also, values less 
than 3 probably don't work very well at the moment.

<tag><tt/hint_topnentry=5/
<item>
Same as hint_nentry, but for the top level menu. Often here are other
entries, added by the Window Manager itself (like Exit, Xterm,
whatever) that menu doesn't know about, so that you may want to
instruct menu to put less entries in the top level menu.

<tag><tt/hint_mixedpenalty=15.0/
<item>
Penalty for `mixed' menus. Mixed menus are those with both submenus
and direct commands in them.

<tag><tt/hint_minhintfreq=0.1/
<item>
Minimal relative frequency for the hints before they are considered.
Internal variable to speed up the tree generation. If you find menu
slow, increase this value (to, say 0.2 or 0.3).

<tag><tt/hint_mlpenalty=2000/
<item>
`max local penalty',
while evaluating the possible trees, menu gives `penalties' for
submenus that don't contain the desired number of submenus. The
penalty is sqrt(n_entry_opt-n_entry), and eventually will be
calculated as a sum of all nodes. But to speed things up, menu will
discard possibilities in which any node has a `local' penalty of more
than hint_mlpenalty. Increase this value if you think menu is
overlooking your favorite tree (also decrease minhintfreq), decrease
this value if you think menu is wasting too much time.
Because of hint_max_ntry, the influence of this variable is nearly
zero nowadays.
<tag><tt/hint_max_ntry=4/
<item>
menu will recursively, for each node, try the hint_max_ntry best local
menu-divisions.

<tag><tt/hints_max_iter_hint=5/
<item>
The search for what hints to use in one menu is rather expensive. But
due to the way things are sorted, menu seems to always find the `best'
match in the first 2% of iterations. Thus, a way to speedup things is
simply to cut of menu searching after `some' iterations are
done. This value controls this, and limits the number of iterations to 
5+hint_max_iter_hint*number_of_possible_hints. Set this value to
negative to disable this.

<tag><tt/hint_debug=false/
<item>
Set to true if you want to see loads and loads of debug output.
</taglist>

<sect> Hints, tree optimization
<p>
The hints actually work in a rather strange way: when
<tt/hint_optimize=true/ then all <tt/$section/ elements are added to
the specified <tt/$hints/ variable, and the order (/Apps/Editors or
/Editors/Apps) of the resulting hints is completely ignored. Then, the
hints for each menu entry are handed to the optimization routine, that
will calculate a reasonable tree for those hints. That tree must
comply with the following:
<p>

When a user looks for a program "Program" with, say, hints 
"Good,Bulky,Heaven", then, while walking through the tree, it should at
every node visited
be clear for the user what submenu to select (or the menu should have
"Program" directly in it). So, the toplevel menu may
look like
<example>
  Good
  Hell
  Microsoft
</example>
because then a searcher for a menu entry with hints "Good,Bulky,Heaven"
will know to select the submenu "Good". The toplevel menu may not look
like
<example>
  Good
  Hell
  Heaven
</example>
as now it isn't clear whether to visit the Good or the Heaven submenu.
<p>
That rule allows usually for many different trees, and the task of the
optimization procedure is to select, in a finite amount of time, the
tree that best matches the user's desire about the optimum number of
menu entries.

<chapt>Variables and functions in the install-menu scripts
<p>

The supported "needs" definitions and "startmenu=", "endmenu="
and "submenutitle=" are interpreted as follows:

<sect> String constants
<p>
  Anything inside double quotes ("") is interpreted as a string, and
  is written verbatim to the output file.
  Stuff like \n, \t, ... will be substituted for their C expansions 
  (But not \0xx, currently).

<sect> Variables
<p>
  Anything matching $[a-z,A-Z,_]* is interpreted as a variable, and
  the corresponding definition from the menu entry is substituted.
</p>
<sect1>  Special variables
<p>
    The following variables are treated in a special way by install-menus,
    either because they are used for other purposes too, or because they
    are modified by install-menus (the ones marked with a "!" are modified
    by install-menus).
<taglist>
<tag>    needs:   
<item>
             Used to determine whether the window manager supports this
             menu entry.
<tag>    command: 
<item>
             If this is undefined, this menu entry is taken as defining
             a sub-menu. (this way you can specify icons of sub-menus).
<tag>    title!:  
<item>
             Used for sorting (see section).
             For sub-menu entries (those with empty command), this
             is initialised to the last part of the section.
             Please, keep the title short (two words at maximum).
             The title is for people who already know what programme
             they want to start. See "longtitle" and "description" below
             for longer descriptions.
<tag>    sort:    
<item>
             Used for sorting (see section). To make sure an entry is
             at the beginning, use something with a low ASCII number,
             like "$". For sorting at the end, use "|"
<tag>    section!:
<item>
             Used to determine the section of the menu entry.
             The menu entries that have a empty $command, ie those that
             define a submenu, have $title added to the end of $section 
             The menu entries that have a non-empty $command have their
             $section modified to $section/$title, or $section/$sort:$title
             if $sort is defined. The menu entries within one submenu
             are sorted according to $section. If you want to retrieve the
             real section name, see the $basesection variable.
<tag>    basesection!:
<item>
             Used to contain the *real* section name. This is useful because
             $section will be changed to $section/$title in special cases
             (see above). This causes a problem when you want to do
             parent($section) because you won't get the real parent section.
             Instead you can use $basesection, which will never contain the
             title.
<tag>    hotkey!: 
<item>
             Modified to reflect what install-menus thinks is the
             most suitable hotkey for this menu entry. The hotkey=
             in the menu entry file is taken as a suggestion, that could
             be overwritten if there is another entry with the same hotkey=.
             To suggest two possible hotkeys for an entry use
             hotkey="ab", with "a" being the most preferred hotkey.
</taglist>
<sect1>
  Preferred variables
<p>
    The following aren't special for install-menus, but it's nice 
    (read: essential) to use the same variables for the same things.
    So, I'll suggest some here. If you want to invent new ones, please
    do so and mail them to me so that I can include them here.
<taglist>
<tag> icon: <item>  
             The location of the icon file for this menu entry.
             If you don't have an icon file, just leave out the icon=
             in the menu entry.
<tag> icon32x32: <item>
             The location of a 32x32 icon file for this menu entry.
<tag> icon16x16: <item> 
             The location of a 16x16 icon file for this menu entry.
             This allows users to choose between 16x16 and 32x32 icon.
<tag> longtitle: <item>
             For people that like descriptive titles (about one line)
             It is probably best to include this in your menu entries,
             while the window-managers don't (by default) put it in the
             menus. That way, people who want descriptive titles can
             turn them on, but others don't need to use them.
<tag> description: <item>
             An even longer description (about 5 lines).
             For example, a description of the documentation in
             the dwww generated html pages.
</taglist>
<sect1>
  Suggested variables
<p>
    The following variables probably shouldn't appear often (or at
    all) in the menu files supplied with packages. They are mostly
    intended for use by local system managers. Nevertheless, it is
    advised that all Debian systems use the following variable names:    
<taglist>   
<tag> visible <item>
             Some apps add entries to utmp the utmp file, so that
             "who" and friends know they are running (this is
             especially true for xterms etc). If $visible set
             (to anything other than "" or "none"), xterms etc will
             not write logging info to utmp. (may not work for
             your window manager).
<tag> geometry <item>
             For X apps, this will be the size of the (main) window
             that will be created (units in either chars or pixels,
             depending on type of main window (xterm or graphic)).
             If you as package maintainer want to use this, you should
             probably think about setting this variable somewhere
             in an Xresources file.
</taglist>   
<sect> Functions
<p>
  Anything matching [a-z,A-Z,_] is taken as a function (and an error
  is generated if the function doesn't exist). The arguments of the
  functions can be other functions, string constants or variables.
<taglist>
<tag> prefix() <item>
     returns the current prefix dir: either $rootprefix, or
     $HOME/$userprefix, depending on who runs install-menu

<tag> ifroot($rootarg, $userarg) <item>
     if(getuid()==0) print $rootarg, else print $userarg

<tag> print($arg)     <item>
     Same as just $arg; if $arg is empty, generate an error.

<tag> nstring($n, $string) <item>
     write $string $n times. So, nstring(3,"Aa") writes "AaAaAa".
     (Useful in combination with level()).

<tag> esc($arg1,$arg2) <item>
     Print $arg1, but escape all occurrences of characters in $arg2
     with a '\' (thus, if arg1="hello", arg2="lo", print "he\l\l\o").

<tag> escwith($arg1, $arg2, $arg3) <item>
     Same as esc, but use $arg3 as escape sequence.

<tag> escfirst($arg1, $arg2, $arg3) <item>
     Same as escwith, but only escapes first occurrence of $arg2.

<tag> cppesc($arg1) <item>
     Escape anything that isn't a letter, number or _ with
     $&lt;hex-ascii-code&gt;. So, for example, a '-' is replaced by '$2D'.
     This way, $arg1 can be used as a #define in cpp.

<tag> tolower($arg)
<tag> toupper($arg) <item>
     Returns the argument set in lowercases resp uppercases. 

<tag> replacewith($s, $replace, $with) <item>
     Search $s for occurrences of characters from string replace, and
     replace them by the corresponding character in $with.
     Example:
      replacewith("hello $world, %dir", "$% ", "123")
      returns:   "hello31world,32dir"

<tag> replace($s, $replace, $with) <item>
     Search $s for occurences of $replace and replace them with $with.
     Note that the behaviour of this function is quite different than the
     replacewith() function.

<tag> ifempty($arg1, $arg2) <item>
     If $arg1 is empty, print $arg2, otherwise print nothing.
     For compatibility, $arg1="none" is interpreted as empty.

<tag> ifnempty($arg1, $arg2)      <item>
     If $arg1 is not empty, print $arg2.
     For compatibility, the string "none" is seen as empty.

<tag> ifelse($arg1,$arg2,$arg3) <item>
     If $arg1 is non-empty, print $arg2, otherwise $arg3.
     For compatibility, the string "none" is seen as empty.

<tag> ifeq($arg1, $arg2, $arg3) <item>
     If ($arg1==$arg2) then print $arg3
<tag> ifneq($arg1, $arg2, $arg3) <item>
     If ($arg1!=$arg2) then print $arg3
<tag> ifeqelse($arg1, $arg2, $arg3, $arg4) <item>
     If ($arg1==$arg2) then print $arg3 else print $arg4

<tag> cond_surr($arg1, $arg2, $arg3) <item>
     If $arg1 is non-empty print $arg2$arg1$arg3, otherwise print nothing.
     For compatibility, $arg1="none" is interpreted as empty.

<tag> iffile($arg1, $arg2) <item>
     If file $arg1 exists, and can be opened for reading by whoever
     started the current process, return $arg2, otherwise return nothing.


<tag> ifelsefile($arg1, $arg2, $arg3) <item>
     If file $arg1 exists, and can be opened for reading by whoever
     started the current process, return $arg2, otherwise return $arg3.

<tag> catfile($arg1) <item>
     Return the contents of file $arg1.

<tag> shell($arg1) <item>
     Return the output of the shell command $arg1.
  
<tag> forall($array, "var", $exec) <item>
     For each element of the column separated array $array, set
     $var to that element, and print $exec.
     Example:
     <example>
      !include lang.h
      forall(sections_translations(), "lang", \ 
         " section[" $lang "]=" translate($lang, title()) "\n")
      </example>

<tag> parent($arg) <item>

     parent("/Debian/Apps/Editors") = "/Debian/Apps".

<tag> basename($arg) <item>

     basename("/Debian/Apps/Editors") = "Apps".

<tag> stripdir($arg) <item>
     everything after the last slash, i.e. what basename() 
     should have returned: stripdir("/Debian/Apps/Editors") = "Editors".

<tag> entrycount() <item>
     the number of entries in this menu.
 
<tag> entryindex() <item>
     returns relative position of this entry. Start with 0,
     last entry is entrycount() - 1.
     BUG: if sort= anything other than $title, then this
     entryindex() will return incorrect values.

<tag> firstentry($arg) <item>
     return $arg if this is the first entry of this menu
     (that is, entryindex() = 0). Else, return nothing.

<tag> lastentry() <item>
     return $arg if this is the last entry in this menu
     (that is, entryindex() = entrycount() -1). Else, return nothing.
     
<tag> level() <item>
     return nesting of this menu in the total menu tree.

<tag> add($arg1,$arg2)
<tag> sub($arg1,$arg2) 
<tag> mult($arg1,$arg2) 
<tag> div($arg1,$arg2) <item>
     returns the sum, difference, product or quotient of $arg1 and
     $arg2. Note that the arguments are strings, that are converted
     to integers.
     example: mult("24", entryindex())
     
<tag> rcfile() 
<tag> examplercfile()  
<tag> mainmenutitle() 
<tag> rootsection() 
<tag> rootprefix() 
<tag> userprefix()

<tag> postoutput() 
<tag> preoutput() 
<item>
     These functions all output whatever they were defined to be in
     the menu-method file.

<tag> translate($lang, $text) <item>
     Translate $text into $lang using gettext, see <tt/forall/ for an
     example.  Note that currently outputlanguage must be set to "C".
     If $lang is the empty string, $text will be translated in the
     current locale language. See sections_translations() for a list
     of available translations.
     
<tag> implicit concatenation <item>
String constants, variables and functions can be concatenated 
by placing them after each other with a space in between, like:
