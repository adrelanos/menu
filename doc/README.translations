In sarge, menu include translations of menu sections names
in various languages. The lists is available in
/etc/menu-methods/lang.h

A) Selecting the language:

1) System-wide:
The simplest way is to set up root locales and menu will be translated
accordingly.

Another solution is to add
outputlanguage="xx"
in /etc/menu-methods/menu.h
where xx is you language code.

2) User-wide: 
Just run update-menus under the locales of your choice.
You can also copy the file 
/etc/menu-methods/<your favorite wm> 
to 
~/.menu-methods/
and add 
outputlanguage="xx" 
where xx is you language code.

3) KDE
Make sure menu-xdg is installed and that root locales are not "C".
Menu will be translated in all languages at once. The users just
need to configure KDE to use their language and menus will follow.

B) Problems:
There are unfortunately lots of reasons why translations would fails:
window-manager not supporting menu translations, not supporting your
locale encoding or not supporting user menus.

You can try to add
outputencoding="LOCALE"
at the start of /etc/menu-methods/<your favorite wm>
and run update-menus under different locale encodings.

C) Screenshots
Some admittedly crappy screenshots are available here:
