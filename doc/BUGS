Reporting menu bugs
---------------------

If you are reporting a bug about the way menus are displayed, please
provide the name and version of the window manager (or menu manager)
you use. You can use the output of 
dpkg-query -l <window manager package name>

-----------------------
If you have a difficult to reproduce problem with install-menu
-----------------------

# update-menus --stdout > /tmp/menu-stdin
# bzip2 /tmp/menu-stdin
# tar -cvf /tmp/tar.tar /tmp/menu-stdin.bz2 #and any other interesting file
# uuencode /tmp/tar.tar /tmp/tar.tar | mail -s tar.tar menu@packages.debian.org

If you want to try out a menu-method yourselve several times
(with minor changes etc), you can use the /tmp/menu-stdin file
this way to start your menu-method without starting update-menus:

/etc/menu-methods/my_wm < /tmp/menu-stdin
